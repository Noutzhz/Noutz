``` print("Hello World")```

I'm from Brazil and my favorite programming language is Python. I work mainly with project development using this amazing language. I'm currently using Visual Studio Code as my main code editor.

I have experience in several interesting projects, such as the implementation and use of the Nmap library, which is a powerful network mapping tool. In addition, I have been exploring other areas of development such as data analysis, web scraping and task automation.

Welcome to explore my projects here on GitHub. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions. Let's collaborate and learn together!

Thanks for the visit!
